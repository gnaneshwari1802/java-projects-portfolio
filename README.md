# Project Name

## Overview
This project is a full-stack web application developed using Java for the back-end, MySQL for data storage, and JavaScript for the front-end. The project is developed and deployed using IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Java (JDK version 8+)
- **Database**: MySQL (for storing and retrieving data)
- **Frontend**: JavaScript (used for the client-side application)
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition
- **Testing**: Postman API

- **Libraries & Frameworks**:
  - [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) (for creating the Java back-end, if used)
  - [JDBC](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/sql/DriverManager.html) (for connecting to MySQL, if applicable)
  - [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) or [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) (or any JavaScript libraries, if used)

## Prerequisites
Before setting up and running the project, make sure you have the following installed:
- [Java JDK 8 or higher](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- [MySQL Database](https://www.mysql.com/)
- [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for managing JavaScript dependencies and running front-end scripts)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git
```

### 2. Set Up the MySQL Database
- Install MySQL on your machine and create a new database for the application.
- You can use MySQL Workbench or the command line to create the database.
  ```sql
  CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;
  ```
- Update the `application.properties` (or `application.yml`) file in the `src/main/resources` directory with your database connection details:
  ```properties
  spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name
  spring.datasource.username=your_username
  spring.datasource.password=your_password
  ```

### 3. Install Dependencies for Java (Backend)
- Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
- Ensure that the project is using the correct JDK version.
- If the project uses Maven or Gradle, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
  - For Maven:
    ```bash
    mvn install
    ```
  - For Gradle:
    ```bash
    gradle build
    ```

### 4. Set Up the Front-End (JavaScript)
- Navigate to the front-end directory (if the front-end is a separate folder).
- Install the JavaScript dependencies using npm or yarn:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  yarn install
  ```

### 5. Run the Application
- **Backend**: Run the Java backend through IntelliJ IDEA by executing the main class or running the project. If using Spring Boot, the backend will run on port `8080` by default.
- **Frontend**: If the front-end is a separate app (e.g., React.js, vanilla JavaScript, or another framework), run the following to start the front-end development server:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  yarn start
  ```
  The front-end will typically be served at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 6. Access the Application
- Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` (or another configured port for the front-end).
- The back-end should be running on `http://localhost:8080` (or whatever port you've configured for the Java application).
- The application will connect to the MySQL database to fetch and store data.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: [Briefly describe any user authentication features, if applicable]
- **CRUD Operations**: [List the CRUD operations available in the application, such as creating, reading, updating, or deleting data]
- **Real-Time Data**: [Mention any real-time features like WebSockets or API calls that keep data up to date]
- [Additional features you want to mention]

## Troubleshooting
- **Database connection issues**: Ensure that MySQL is running, and the credentials in the `application.properties` file are correct.
- **Frontend errors**: Check the browser's console for error messages and ensure that the front-end dependencies are installed correctly.
- **Backend not starting**: Verify that the Java version and dependencies are correctly set up in IntelliJ IDEA.
